# Word_Weaver

Word_Weaver is a Python-based Mad Libs generator that creates humorous and nonsensical stories by filling in placeholders with user-provided words. This project is designed to provide an interactive and entertaining way to generate Mad Libs stories.

## Features

- **Dynamic Story Generation**: Word_Weaver reads a template story with placeholders and prompts the user to input various types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).
- **Customizable Stories**: Users can customize the story by providing their own words, leading to unique and often hilarious results.
- **Easy to Use**: The program is straightforward to use, with a simple command-line interface for inputting words.

3. Run the program:
